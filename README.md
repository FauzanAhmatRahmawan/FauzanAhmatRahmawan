# Hi There 👋 , I'm Fauzan Ahmat Rahmawan
I am a Software QA Engineer with 3+ years of experience across banking, fintech, and enterprise systems specializing in Manual Testing, Automation Testing (Katalon), API Testing (Postman), Performance Testing (JMeter), and SQL data validation.
I excel at bridging business requirements with technical execution. I frequently collaborate with Business Analysts, Developers, and Product/Project Managers to refine acceptance criteria, clarify requirement gaps, and ensure every feature meets both business value and system behavior expectations.

My strengths include:
• Test Planning and Test Analysis Strategy
• Manual & Automation Testing, API Testing, Performance Testing
• Requirement Business Analysis, Process Mapping, BRD/FRD/PRD
• Cross-functional coordination & stakeholder communication
